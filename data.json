They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"2018-05-18T11:12","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin","posting_date":"2021-3-2"},{"text":" FAA Can’t Explain Pilot’s UFO Sighting Last Weekend Over New Mexico","date_time":"2021-05-12T13:19","city":"New Mexico","state":"New Mexico","shape":"Oval","duration":"1","summary":"Experts say there is usually a very logical explanation for UFO sightings, and the U.S. government has had a famously long history of being tight-lipped on the subject.
